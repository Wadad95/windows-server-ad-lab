# File Services and NTFS Permissions

## Overview
This document describes the file services configuration used in the lab.

## File shares
File shares are created to store department data and are accessed via network
paths.

## NTFS permissions
Permissions are assigned using security groups rather than individual users
to simplify administration.

## Access control
Different access levels (read, modify) are applied based on department roles
and responsibilities.
